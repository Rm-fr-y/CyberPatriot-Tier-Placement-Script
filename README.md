# CyberPatriot-Tier-Placement-Script
For all of you that worry about your Tier placements during Round 2, this script will figure it out for you. \
Make sure that the Round 1 Final Scores CSV is saved with the filename of RD1_scores.csv. \

To get the csv file you must - \
Convert the RD1 final scores xlsx file provided by AFA CyberPatriot at https://www.uscyberpatriot.org/competition/current-competition/scores to a csv. \
You can use a tool like freeconvert.com to achieve this. \ 
Rename the csv to RD1_scores.csv \

Make sure to install the requirements and keep the Round 1 Final scores saved as a CSV in the same directory as the script. \
Command to install requirements: pip install requests
